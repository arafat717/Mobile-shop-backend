# Pocket Tech Hub Backend

The Pocket Tech Hub Backend serves as the server-side component of the Pocket Tech Hub web application, providing APIs to handle product management, user interactions, and database operations. Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, this backend ensures seamless communication between the frontend and the database.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing mobile products, user accounts, and orders.
- **Data Validation**: Validate incoming data to ensure consistency and prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully to provide meaningful responses to clients.
- **Middleware**: Utilize middleware functions for tasks such as logging, request validation, and authentication.
- **Database Integration**: Connect and interact with MongoDB to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js, used for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing application data.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser, used for building scalable server-side applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/arafat717/Mobile-shop-backend.git`
